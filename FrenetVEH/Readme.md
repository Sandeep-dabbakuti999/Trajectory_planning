### Frenet Frame (Moving trihedron)
The Frenet is a right-handed coordinate system determined by the tangent line and a curvature. 
The frame, which locally describes one point on a curve, changes orientation along its length.


S => Longitudinal displacement along the curve 


D => Lateral Displacement along the curve
